- Add a basic dashboard. [Christian Schwede]

  This adds a basic dashboard using AngularJS and the managesf REST API.
  Currently listing, creating and deleting projects is supported and the open
  reviews and bugs are shown.

  An additional method was added to managesf to GET project infos including open
  issues and reviews. The data for this call is internally cached for 15 seconds
  because this triggers at least four internal REST API calls.

- Add the force option for project deletion on Gerrit. [Fabien Boucher]

  Add by default force=True to managesf for project
  deletion. A project not empty (with open patchsets)
  is not removed on Gerrit it the force option is not given
  to the API of Gerrit.

  Boucher]

  A recent update of python-redmine made our unitests
